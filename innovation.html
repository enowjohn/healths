            <h2>Explore Our Innovations</h2>
            <p>In 2022, we reached out to 144 healthcare providers and healthcare executives from 52 different countries and asked them to share their thoughts on implementing digital health solutions within their organizations. What were the main challenges they faced? What type of evidence did they use to inform their decision-making? 

                The answers we received varied, covering an array of perspectives and concerns depending on job types and geography. However, a few overarching themes emerged. First, it is clear that economics plays a major role in the slow adoption of digital health solutions. The majority of healthcare leaders surveyed stated that budgetary limitations were the biggest obstacle to implementation. Second, evidence is king. Survey participants across the board considered all types of evidence as extremely important for making purchasing decisions. </p>
